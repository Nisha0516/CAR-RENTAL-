## 🔗 How It Works: Owner → Customer Flow

### When Owner Adds a Car:

```
1. Owner fills AddCars form
   ↓
2. Frontend calls ownerAPI.addCar(carData)
   ↓
3. POST /api/owner/cars with JWT token
   ↓
4. Backend associates car with owner (from token)
   ↓
5. Car saved in database with owner reference
   ↓
6. Car status: "pending" (waiting for admin approval)
   ↓
7. Admin reviews & approves car
   ↓
8. Car status: "approved"
   ↓
9. Car appears on customer home page
   ↓
10. Customer sees car with owner name! 🎉
```

### Database Structure:

```javascript
Car Document {
  _id: "car123",
  model: "Toyota Innova",
  make: "Toyota",
  year: 2023,
  licensePlate: "KA01AB1234",
  pricePerDay: 1500,
  owner: "owner_user_id",  // ← Owner reference
  isApproved: true,
  availability: true,
  // ... other fields
}

// When fetched for customers:
Car with Owner {
  ...carFields,
  owner: {
    _id: "owner_user_id",
    name: "Rajesh Kumar",  // ← Owner name displayed!
    email: "rajesh@example.com",
    phone: "+91 9876543210"
  }
}
```
