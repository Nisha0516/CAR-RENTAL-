## 🧪 How to Test Admin Module

### Step 1: Create Admin User
Since there's no public admin signup, create one first:

**Add to `backend/server.js` temporarily:**
```javascript
app.post('/api/create-admin', async (req, res) => {
  const User = require('./models/User');
  const admin = await User.create({
    name: 'Admin',
    email: 'admin@admin.com',
    password: 'admin123',
    phone: '9999999999',
    role: 'admin',
    drivingLicense: 'N/A'
  });
  res.json({ success: true, admin });
});
```

**Run:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/create-admin
```

**Remove this route after creating admin!**

### Step 2: Login as Admin
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/admin/login
2. Email: admin@admin.com
3. Password: admin123
4. Should redirect to admin dashboard
