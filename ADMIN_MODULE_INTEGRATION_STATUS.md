## What's Being Done:

I'm systematically connecting ALL admin components to the backend API. Each component will:

âœ… Fetch real data from `adminAPI`  
âœ… Handle loading states  
âœ… Display error messages  
âœ… Include CRUD operations  
âœ… Have proper pagination  
âœ… Include filters/search

## Files Being Integrated:

1. âœ… `Dashboard.js` - Backend connected
2. ðŸ”„ `AllBookings.js` - Next
3. ðŸ”„ `ManageCars.js`
4. ðŸ”„ `ManageUser.js`
5. ðŸ”„ `ManageOwners.js`
6. ðŸ”„ `Report.js`

**Total: 7 files** (1 done, 6 to go)

## Time Estimate: ~30-45 minutes for all
