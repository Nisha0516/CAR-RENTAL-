**Issue:** "Cannot find module jspdf"
**Fix:** This is normal! Just click OK and use the app. Install jspdf only if you want PDF downloads.

**Issue:** "Images not loading"
**Fix:** Normal - mock data uses placeholder paths. Cars show emoji icons instead.

**Issue:** "Port 3000 already in use"
**Fix:** Close other React apps or use: `PORT=3001 npm start`
